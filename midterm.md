# Project Progress Report

## Progress So Far

I have made significant progress in defining the **inputs and outputs** for my code. One of the key milestones achieved is the implementation of my **Runge-Kutta function** in **C++**. This function is currently designed specifically for my system of equations, but I have structured it in a way that allows it to be **toggled into a generic Runge-Kutta solver**.

My next step is to integrate this function into a **script file** that will automate the system. This script will take inputs, process them, and generate **plot outputs** to visualize the results efficiently. To maintain and organize the dataset, I will store all data within **structs**, ensuring a structured approach to data management.

Additionally, I plan to **expand my dataset** by automating the data acquisition process from the script. This will eliminate manual intervention, improve efficiency, and allow for seamless data collection, making the system more robust.

## Challenges and Considerations

One of the key challenges I foresee is **memory allocation and data storage**. Given the large amount of data generated, **efficient memory management** will be essential to prevent excessive computational costs. The **data generation and handling process** appears to be quite resource-intensive, so I am curious to see how well **C++** performs in optimizing these tasks.

Moving forward, my focus will be on integrating the **Runge-Kutta function** into the script, refining the data storage strategy using **structs**, and addressing potential performance bottlenecks related to memory and data efficiency.
